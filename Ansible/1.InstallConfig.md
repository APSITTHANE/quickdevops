 # Installation and Configuration

## Step 1 - Installing Ansible

 To configure the PPA on your machine and install ansible run these commands:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install ansible

## Step 2 - Configure Hosts

All host information is kept in the hosts files as follows

    $ sudo gedit /etc/ansible/hosts

-------------------------------------

## Step 3 - Servers Setup

  ### Install ssh on the server and your host also

    $ sudo apt install ssh

    Check from your computer to server you can connect using the ssh

    $ ssh tayyabali@192.168.1.101

    This will ask username and password

### If you want to enable root login on over ssh then follow following commands

    # gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    Change the line "PermitRootLogin" to "yes"

    # service sshd restart

    $ ssh root@192.168.1.101

    You will be able to connect to the server using root username

### Create ansible user with sudo permissions

 On the server where you will be configuring you need to have a user with sudo permissions and authentication method must not need password. i.e use ssh keys

    # adduser ansible
    # usermod -aG sudo ansible

### Setup ssh keys

      On the our computer from where we will be managing ansible

      $ ssh-keygen
        accept all default options

      $ cd /home/tayyabali/.ssh/
       you can see all keys here at this place

       Copy the Public Key on server where we created ansible user

       $ ssh-copy-id ansible@192.168.1.1019
       Input password

      Now try

      $ ssh ansible@192.168.1.101

      You will be logged in without password

### Disable Password Authentication (Recommended)
      On Server (Where we have ansible user):
      Now oce you have configured the key based login, now you can disable the password besed auth

      $ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

      Change follwoing parameter to no as shown below

          PasswordAuthentication no

      $ sudo systemctl reload sshd

### Set Up a Basic Firewall

    $ sudo ufw app list
    $ sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    $ sudo ufw enable
    $ sudo ufw status
