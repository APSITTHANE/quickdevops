## Redirection - Ports and Volumes

Lets see which all images we have available

      $ docker images

Lets run the ngins container

      $ docker run -d nginx:latest

To check the Ip address

      $ docker inspect stupefied_ramanujan | grep IPAddr

Check the nginx is running using the elinks

      $elinks 172.17.0.2
      $elinks localhost

      Here container will show the web page but the localhost will not.

      How to redirect from local port to container ?

Lets stop the container

      $ docker stop stupefied_ramanujan

      and also lets remove the container also

      $ docker rm `docker ps -a -q`

      Above will remove all containers

## Port redirection

      $ docker images
